                <p>So we help <em>___ like yourself go from being confused and frustrated by their persistent wrist pain, which they've often tried to resolve for years without success and have explored 3-5 avenues of care to getting back to doing what they want to do with work and their hobbies without thinking about pain and feel confident and secure in pursuing any professional or individual passions</em></p>
                
                <p><em>I help high-performing professionals eliminate chronic wrist pain—even after years of failed treatments—so they can use their hands again without thinking about pain.</em></p>
                
                <p>So they can get back to doing what they want without thinking about pain. Is that clear?</p>
                
                <p>And we typically work with clients like you who have struggled with _____ (label their specific pain) and we help them by</p>

                    <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Establishing their capacity and Building their endurance</li>
                    <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Teaching them how to safely increasing wrist & hand use with work and hobbies</li>
                    <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Improving their understanding of pain</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Does that make sense?</strong></p>
                
                <p>We do this by giving you access to our step by step recovery system inside the 1HP App. It starts by establishing a comprehensive baseline with me or Dr. Smithson, then establishes a plan, helps you understand how to progress and manage any situation throughout recovery</p>
                
                <p>You also get access private community where you can ask questions anytime, get quick feedback, and stay connected with others going through the same process.</p>
                
                <p>and most importantly you'll get direct access to me or anyone on our team. We will be there every step of the way because You'll have ten one-on-one check-in calls to make sure you're improving as quickly as possible and every week we'll host live Zoom Clinics where I go through questions you can submit (anonymously), review real cases and questions live, and help members troubleshoot whatever's getting in their way.</p>
                
                <p>The goal's simple — you'll have a clear structure, constant support, and a real path back to full capacity.</p>

Like I said before, my goal is to help you make the best decision for yourself moving forward, and I completely understand needing to speak with your partner, I mean I'm not in the business of breaking up relationships, but if this decision was exclusively up to you and you didn't have anyone you needed to talk to, what would you decide to do?

Well, considering you've decided this is right for you and you've said your partner would be 100% supportive, do you know what the only thing that could possibly hold you back is? Losing momentum. I've seen it happen too many times: someone is ready, their partner is completely supportive, but they pause, and in that pause they talk themselves out of it. And do you know what changes in their life? Absolutely nothing.</p>

                <h4>STEP 2: TRUST</h4>
                
                <p>Can I be 100% honest with you?</p>
                
                <p>Like I said before, my goal is to help you make the best decision for yourself moving forward. That said, you just told me you feel confident this program has everything you need to succeed, and I could feel your excitement about getting started. But now that the decision is real, you don't sound certain at all. So let me ask you, what's really going on? Is it the fear, or is it the risk of making the decision?</p>

                    <h4>STRONG STORY 1 - Addressing the Real Cause</h4>
                    <p>Nothing works when you don't know what you're actually targeting.</p>
                    
                    <p>The reason your past attempts failed is because they focused on symptoms. What we do is assess your capacity, your load tolerance, and the mechanical bottlenecks keeping you stuck.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once we identify those, the path becomes predictable — and we adjust every step until your capacity exceeds your demands.</p>
                    
                    <p>That's why this doesn't fail.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="important">
                    <h4>STRONG STORY 2 - Time vs. Money</h4>
                    <p>Can I be really honest with you? I love that you feel some fear and see this as risky because it means you'll take it seriously and do whatever it takes to succeed.</p>
                    
                    <p>But here's the truth, you're going to actually pay for this anyways. You can learn every lesson in the Power Leveling Program on your own. The information is definitely out there. Do you want it to take 12 weeks or 5 years.</p>
                    
                    <p>Because everything that we've learned in the past decade from helping thousands of people just like you we've put into the program AND you'll be getting direct support from us</p>
                    
                    <p>So you don't have to do trial and error for five more years while you get more conflicting information from doctors and get scared from doomer posts.</p>
                    
                    <p>So the question is: Not whether you are going to buy it or not. Just how are you going to pay. With your money… your time. Is it going to be this same cycle of what you have already experience that didn't really get you anywhere or something that has been proven to help people like you get somewhere.</p>
                    
                    <p>And if I'm being real, you've probably already been paying with time for the last 1-2 years</p>

                <h4>STEP 3: ASK</h4>
                
                <p>Does that make sense?</p>
                
                <p>How does that feel?</p>
                
                <p>Are you ready to get started?</p>
